- Fix installation of the GUI.

DiVinE 2.5.1 (5.4.2011)
=======================

- DVE compiler fixes: initial state in some models could be incorrect in
  compiled DVE. When the system was in deadlock and LTL property had been
  present, the resulting model could overwrite origin states, causing the model
  checker to misbehave. Both these problems are fixed in this release.

DiVinE 2.5 (28.2.2011)
======================

- A faster hash table implementation.
- A new tool, "divine draw", for state space visualisation (using graphviz).
- More compact state representation in the DVE compiler.
- Fix a bug in MAP where self-loops could be missed.
- Support for a new input language, CoIN, available with all algorithms.
- Fix a couple of bugs in the DVE compiler. The binary models could cause
  infinite loops in DiVinE or lead to incorrect state spaces.
- Add support for "divine combine" on Windows.
- A new option, --gnuplot-statistics, for machine-readable queue size stats.

DiVinE 2.4 (29.9.2010)
======================

- C3 check for parallel partial order reduction.
- Partial order reduction for (interpreted) DVE (--por).
- Real-time hashtable & queue statistics (--statistics).
- Custom generators are not allowed with pool-less builds.
- Further optimisations to the exploration engine (hash table, FIFOs, MPI).
- Better --version output.
- In addition to G++, DiVinE can be compiled with Clang now.
- More fixes in MPI.
- A curses-based interface for observing runtime algorithm behaviour.
- Dual-threaded nested DFS (Holzmann '07).
- Counterexamples in (single-threaded) nested DFS.
- Enable on-the-fly heuristic in distributed (MPI) OWCTY.
- Make "divine verify" work with non-DVE inputs correctly.
- Fix BA translation of F((F a) U b) form formulae (J. Strejcek &c.)

DiVinE 2.3 (8.8.2010)
=====================

- Basic support for Murphi model compilation and parallel verification.
- Fix a bug in DVE compiler that made some models uncompilable.
- Improved, distributed (MPI-enabled) MAP algorithm.
- Track state space statistics in OWCTY (--report).
- Proper deadlock detection (with traces) for all model types.
- Improved --report output format consistency.
- Fix handling of committed states in the DVE compiler.
- Multiple stability and correctness fixes in distributed memory support (MPI).
- Limit the override of global allocator to avoid occasional crashes in glibc.
- Add an option to limit maximum verification runtime (--max-time, POSIX only).

Furthermore, a new binary ABI is available in this release. There are two
caveats though:

  1) The ABI is NOT STABLE and should not be relied upon. It will be subject of
  further changes in future releases.

  2) The win32 support is somewhat limited, since some models may expect access
  to symbols exported by the divine binary itself, which is not supported on
  win32.

DiVinE 2.2 (17.2.2010)
======================

- Further optimisations in compiled DVE.
- Improved overall performance of the verifier.
- "divine combine" can be used again (it's been broken in previous releases)
- Compiled models can now be loaded on Windows.
- New option, -i (--initial-table) to set intial hashtable size. This can be
  used to further improve performance, assuming knowledge of model size.

An overall speed improvement of 20 - 30 % may be expected for dual-core
reachability and LTL verification when using compiled DVE, over version
2.1.1. Please note that dve.so files generated by this version are not
compatible with DiVinE 2.1.1.

KNOWN ISSUES: Error state handling is not consistent between interpreted and
compiled DVE. The profiled build (-DPROFILE=ON) is currently broken. (Both
issues exist since version 2.1.)

========================

- The GUI can now be compiled & used on Windows.
- A number of GUI improvements and usability fixes.

DiVinE 2.0 (19.11.2009)
=======================

- The divine.combine binary has been removed, use "divine combine" instead.

DiVinE Multi-Core 1.4 (23.4.2009)
=================================

- Unfortunately, an incorrect implementation of Nested DFS has slipped into the
  1.3 release. Version 1.4 fixes this problem.
- Early counterexample discovery in OWCTY has been improved: accepting
  self-loops are now detected on-the-fly, and early termination is now more
  efficient.

DiVinE Multi-Core 1.3 (17.11.2008)
==================================

- Improved and newly included algorithms:
  - MAP: improved progress reports, early termination and counterexamples
  - Nested DFS for single-threaded verification (no counterexamples)
- A new "verify" subcommand to run the most suitable algorithm for given
  input and number of cores (currently does not produce counterexamples when
  used with -w 1 due to the abovementioned Nested DFS limitation).
- Counterexample generation in OWCTY has suffered from a bug that prevented it
  from finishing in any reasonable time on some property/model combinations.
  This has been fixed.
- A few other user experience fixes: improved warnings and overall robustness.

DiVinE Multi-Core 1.2.1 (1.11.2008)
===================================

- Fix compilation with g++ 4.3.
- Update the bundled version of HOARD to 3.7.1.

  discovery of counterexample.
- Added divine-mc.combine to the distribution.
- Added report generation functionality (-r commandline switch) to facilitate
  mass experimental runs.
- New commandline switch --max-memory to limit address space available to the
  tool. Can be used to avoid swapping.
- Counterexample generation can now be disabled through --no-counterexample
  commandline switch.
- A dummy high-speed state space generator for performance analysis. It is used
  when no input file is given.

  compiler. ProMeLa models can be verified, although no counterexample
  generation is implemented.
- Developer documentation updates.
