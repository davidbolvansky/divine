DiVinE Multi-Core 1.1
=====================

  discovery of counterexample.
- Added divine-mc.combine to the distribution.
- Added report generation functionality (-r commandline switch) to facilitate
  mass experimental runs.
- New commandline switch --max-memory to limit address space available to the
  tool. Can be used to avoid swapping.
- Counterexample generation can now be disabled through --no-counterexample
  commandline switch.
- A dummy high-speed state space generator for performance analysis. It is used
  when no input file is given.
