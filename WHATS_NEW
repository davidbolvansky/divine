DiVinE 2.0
==========

- This version is a major rewrite of the parallel framework and algorithms.
- MPI is now partially supported in addition to shared memory parallelism
  OpenMPI 1.3 is recommended.
- Support for running on Windows (win32) machines (shared memory only).
- It is now possible to load models in form of ELF shared objects (POSIX only).
- More data available in --report (including machine-readable counterexample).
- The divine.combine binary has been removed, use "divine combine" instead.

DiVinE Multi-Core 1.3
=====================

- Improved and newly included algorithms:
  - MAP: improved progress reports, early termination and counterexamples
  - Nested DFS for single-threaded verification (no counterexamples)
- A new "verify" subcommand to run the most suitable algorithm for given
  input and number of cores (currently does not produce counterexamples when
  used with -w 1 due to the abovementioned Nested DFS limitation).
- Counterexample generation in OWCTY has suffered from a bug that prevented it
  from finishing in any reasonable time on some property/model combinations.
  This has been fixed.
- A few other user experience fixes: improved warnings and overall robustness.

DiVinE Multi-Core 1.2.1
=======================

- Fix compilation with g++ 4.3.
- Update the bundled version of HOARD to 3.7.1.
- Include some updates to the bundled version of wibble (no major impact on
  DiVinE itself).

DiVinE Multi-Core 1.2
=====================

- A few minor bugfixes.
- The divine-mc.combine utility can now handle .mdve and .mprobdve files.
- Parallel shared-memory probabilistic model checker ProbDiVinE-MC has been
  added to the distribution, built as divine-mc.probabilistic.
- NIPS interpreter updated to version 1.2.8

DiVinE Multi-Core 1.1
=====================

- The OWCTY algorithm now performs an on-the-fly heuristic to speed up
  discovery of counterexample.
- Added divine-mc.combine to the distribution.
- Added report generation functionality (-r commandline switch) to facilitate
  mass experimental runs.
- New commandline switch --max-memory to limit address space available to the
  tool. Can be used to avoid swapping.
- Counterexample generation can now be disabled through --no-counterexample
  commandline switch.
- A dummy high-speed state space generator for performance analysis. It is used
  when no input file is given.
- A prototype ProMeLa state space generator and an accompanying bytecode
  compiler. ProMeLa models can be verified, although no counterexample
  generation is implemented.
- Developer documentation updates.
