%description
DiVinE is a tool for LTL model checking and reachability analysis of discrete
distributed systems. The tool is able to efficiently exploit the aggregate
computing power of multiple network-interconnected multi-cored workstations in
order to deal with extremely large verification tasks. As such it allows to
analyse systems whose size is far beyond the size of systems that can be
handled with regular sequential tools.

# "configure" is from cmake, not GNU, so there is no libdir option to invoke.
# Therefore, ignore the rpmlint warning from this line:
./configure -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DPROMELA_JARS=

# Use "make -k" so we can get all the errors at once; this is particularly
# helpful with koji builds. Use VERBOSE=1 so we can check options invoked.
make -k %{?_smp_mflags} VERBOSE=1
