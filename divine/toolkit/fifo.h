 * A simple queue (First-In, First-Out). Concurrent access to the ends of the
 * queue is supported -- a thread may write to the queue while another is
 * reading. Concurrent access to a single end is, however, not supported.
 *
 * The NodeSize parameter defines a size of single block of objects. By
 * default, we make the node a page-sized object -- this seems to work well in
 * practice. We rely on the allocator to align the allocated blocks reasonably
 * to give good cache usage.
