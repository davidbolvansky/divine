This document outlines the features that are not currently available in DIVINE
but are planned for a future release. When new features are included in minor
releases (as they become available), they are removed from this
list. Therefore, if a feature you were interested in is gone from here, please
check the latest documentation and release notes before contacting us.

DIVINE 4.1 (July 2017)
======================

- Update LLVM to 3.9 or 4.0. [P. Ročkai]

## Virtual Machine

- Weak pointer support: allow marking pointers so that they do not count
  towards state comparison. That is, if program states only differ in
  weakly-reachable data, they are considered identical for the purposes of
  model checking. [P. Ročkai]
- Delta-compression of heap snapshots using logarithmically-deep delta chains
  to reduce memory use of snapshots (that is, objid → content maps). [P.
  Ročkai]
- Delta-compression of heap data. Like above, but for object data (content).
  [P. Ročkai]
- Implement a `__vm_syscall` hypercall, to allow access from the system under
  test to the outside operating system. The SUT (that is, the operating system
  running in DiVM) is responsible for translating system calls into a form
  suitable for the outside operating system. Clearly, `__vm_syscall` will only
  be available in execution modes (`divine run`) but not in verification. [P.
  Ročkai]
- Expose the object id hint as a VM (control) register, to allow truly
  invisible actions. [P. Ročkai]

## Model Checking

- Add a (sequential) implementation of the Nested DFS algorithm for accepting
  cycle detection [P. Ročkai]
- Re-introduce a context-switch-directed safety checking algorithm [V. Štill]
- Add a formula-tracing-based symbolic algorithm and SMT solver
  integration. [V. Štill]
- Add a parallel SCC decomposition algorithm based on an union-find data
  structure [P. Ročkai]
- Add a translator from LTL to a DiOS-compatible monitor automaton. [T. Kučera]

## DiOS

- Implementat the `fork()` system call [Z. Baranová & H. Mrázek]
- Add an interface that would allow monitoring the program, in particular
  enforcing global invariants [H. Mrázek]
- Implement a fair scheduler that'd allow model checking of simple (safety)
  properties with fairness assumptions (e.g. that a particular program location
  is reached in every possible execution / thread interleaving of the program).
  [H. Mrázek]
- Add a forwarding mode for DiOS, where system calls are, instead of being
  simulated, forwarded to the real OS using `__vm_syscall`. [K. Kejstová]
- Implement unbuffered stdio in `libc`. [V. Štill]
- Implement program-variable -- formula-variable tracking. [V. Štill]

## User Interface

- Make the stdout of all relevant commands a valid, machine-parseable YAML. [V. Štill]
- Re-introduce SQL-based reporting. [V. Štill]
- Implement a `search` command in `divine sim`, that will automatically look
  for an error in a given maximal distance from a particular program state. [P. Ročkai]

## Testing Coverage

- Make it possible to run the pdclib testsuite in DIVINE. [V. Štill]
- Import and allow execution of the libc++ testsuite in DIVINE. [V. Štill]

DIVINE 4.2 (January 2018)
=========================

- Implement bit-precise initialisation tracking.
- Track partial pointers.
- Implement adjustable τ-reduction to allow monitors that react to each change
  in a particular variable (even if that change is invisible to other threads).
- Implement loading of multiple bitcode files (i.e. multiple executable images)
  into a single virtual machine instance.
- Add a C/C++ expression evaluator and make it available in `divine sim`.
- Add an implementation of Coloured (shared-memory parallel) Nested DFS.
- Optimise handling of shadow memory (that is, tracking of pointers and
  uninitialised values) in the VM.
- A tracing mode for DiOS, where a single execution in a forwarding mode (based
  on `__vm_syscall`) is recorded and re-used for verification.
- Implement model checking of livenesss properties expressed in terms of LTL
  formulae, including fairness assumptions.
- Data-symbolic model checking.
- Implement divine-cc and divine-ld as drop-in replacements for the system
  compiler and linker. [V. Štill]
