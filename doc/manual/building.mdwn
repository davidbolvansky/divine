Installation
============

This section is only relevant when you are installing from source.  We will
assume that you have obtained a source tarball from http://divine.fi.muni.cz,
eg. `divine-4.0.tar.gz`.

Prerequisites
-------------

* A POSIX-compatible operating system
* GNU C++ (4.9 or newer) or clang (3.2 or newer)
* CMake \[[www.cmake.org](http://www.cmake.org)\] 3.2 or newer
* About 12GB of disk space and 4GB of RAM (18GB for both release and debug
  builds)
* ninja build system (optional)
  \[[ninja-build.org](https://ninja-build.org)\] for faster build
* Pandoc (optional) \[[pandoc.org](http://pandoc.org)\] for formatting the
  manual (HTML and PDF with pdflatex)

Building & Installing
---------------------

First, unzip the distribution tarball and enter the newly created directory

    $ tar xvzf divine-4.0.tar.gz
    $ cd divine-4.0

The build is driven by a GNU Makefile, and should be fully automatic. You only
need to run:

    $ make

(On non-GNU systems, GNU make may be available as `gmake`). This will first
build a C++14 toolchain and a runtime required to build DIVINE itself, then
proceed to compile DIVINE.

After a while, you should obtain the main DIVINE binary. You can check that
this is indeed the case by running:

    $ ./_build.release/tools/divine help

You can now run DIVINE from its build directory, or you can optionally install
it by issuing

    $ make install

You can also run the test-suite if you like:

    $ make check
