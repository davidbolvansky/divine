Download
========

The latest release of DIVINE is **4.0**, available as a source tarball:
[divine-@version@.tar.gz](download/divine-@version@.tar.gz). You can also download
[nightly snapshots] [6] or fetch the source code from our version control
repository (you may need to install [darcs] [3]):

    $ darcs get http://divine.fi.muni.cz/current divine

To build the sources, you only need to run `make`. For a summary of changes
between releases, please consult our [release notes] [1] and for help with
installation, [detailed installation instructions] [4] are available in our
[manual] [5].

Alternatively, you can also download [older versions] [2]. Please note,
however, that DiVinE Cluster, DiVinE Multi-Core and ProbDiVinE have been
discontinued and the 3.x branch of DIVINE is no longer actively maintained
either.

Virtual Machine Images
----------------------

Since building DIVINE can be a time-consuming process, once a stable release of
DIVINE 4 is available, we will provide pre-built VM images for quick
evaluation.
