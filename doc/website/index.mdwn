DIVINE is a modern, explicit-state model checker. Based on the LLVM toolchain,
it can verify programs written in multiple real-world programming languages,
including **C** and **C++**.  The verification core is built on a foundation of
high­-per­for­mance algorithms and data structures, scaling all the way from a
laptop to a high-end cluster.  Learn more in the [manual](manual.html).

DIVINE 4 Coming This Summer
===========================

[2016-05-31] A major update of our class-leading model checker is scheduled for
release in summer 2016. The new release will bring a new, flexible execution
environment, based on the traditional hypervisor -- operating system -- user
pro­gram division, along with a more efficient multi-threaded verification core.
The user interface has also seen major improvements. Finally, the upcoming
version of DIVINE will make working with counterexamples a much smoother and
more pleasant experience.
