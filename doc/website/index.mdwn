> <span class="divine">DIVINE</span> is a modern explicit-state model
> checker. Building on high­-per­for­mance algorithms and data structures, it
> offers unparalleled versatility, sca­ling from a typical developer's laptop,
> up to a high-end compute cluster. What more, it can verify a wide range of
> languages, including **C** and **C++**. Learn more in the
> [manual](manual.html), or [try it out](try.cgi).

Feature Highlights
==================

 * Verifies models in multiple **input formats**:
    - **LLVM** bitcode (suitable for model checking C and C++ code)
    - **UPPAAL** timed automata
    - **DVE** -- the original DIVINE modelling language
    - user-implemented, compiled models via [CESMI] [3]
    - **MurPHI**, including symmetry reduction
    - **CoIn** -- for modelling with component interaction automata
 * Executes on a cluster of multi-core machines
 * Partial order reduction for DVE, CoIn
 * Runs on **Linux** and **MS Windows** (a Windows installer is available)
 * A **GUI**, with a simulator and a counter-example analyser for DVE

Automated Release Process
=========================

(2014-11-30) A new automated release process has been rolled out for DIVINE,
based on results from our Continuous Integration system. The latest available
release is always available from the [download page] [1] as a source
tarball. Automatically built binaries for major operating systems will be made
available in the future as well. The [release notes] [2] document lists
important user-visible changes between releases.
