/*
 * Alur-Taubenfeld
 * ===============
 *
 *  Discrete time model of Alur-Taubenfeld fast timing-based mutual exclusion
 *  algorithm.
 *
 *  *tags*: mutual exclusion, C99
 *
 * Description
 * -----------
 *
 *  One significant drawback of Fischer's real time mutual exclusion protocol
 *  (see *fischer.c*) is that a process must delay itself even in the absence of
 *  contention. This problem was addressed by Lamport, who constructed a fast
 *  timing-based algorithm (i.e., one in which a process performs *O(1)*
 *  shared-memory accesses and executes no delay statements in the absence of
 *  contention). This algorithm was later improved by Alur and Tabenfeld, who
 *  eliminated the assumption of apriori-known upper bound on the critical-section
 *  execution time.
 *
 *  When compiled with `-DBUG1`, delayed thread doesn't wait long enough for other
 *  threads that have passed the test `y=0`, to update the variable `y`.
 *  Timer can release the delayed thread "at the same time" as the thread that is
 *  about to update the variable `y`. The previously delayed thread can than be
 *  scheduled to continue to the critical section (skipping `goto Start`),
 *  followed be the other thread.
 *
 *  When compiled with `-DBUG2`, thread that is leaving the CS will set `y` to 0,
 *  even if its value isn't of his identificator. Now imagine that there are two
 *  other threads: `A`,`B`, where `A` is only in the beginning of the algorithm,
 *  while `B` have already skipped the line: `goto Start` (before `y` was set to 0).
 *  `B` can continue because `z` equals 0 (there is no thread in the CS at this
 *  moment) and enter the CS. But thread `A` has nothing in his way as well,
 *  since `y` equals 0.
 *  This error can really occur only if `NUM_OF_THREADS` is at least 3.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 *
 *  - `BUG1`: if defined than the algorithm is incorrect and violates the safety and the exclusion property
 *  - `BUG2`: another artifical bug, breaking the validity of the same set of properties as `BUG1`
 *  - `NUM_OF_THREADS`: a number of threads requesting to enter the critical section
 *
 * LTL Properties
 * --------------
 *
 *  - `progress`: if a thread requests to enter a critical section, it will eventually be allowed to do so
 *  - `exclusion`: critical section can only be executed by one process at a time
 *
 * Verification
 * ------------
 *
 *  - all available properties with the default values of parameters:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm at.c
 *         $ divine verify -p assert at.bc -d
 *         $ divine verify -p deadlock at.bc -d
 *         $ divine verify -p progress at.bc -f -d
 *         $ divine verify -p exclusion at.bc -d
 *
 *  - introducing a bug:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-DBUG1" at.c -o at-bug1.bc
 *         $ divine verify -p assert at-bug1.bc -d
 *         $ divine verify -p exclusion at-bug1.bc -d
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-DBUG2" at.c -o at-bug2.bc
 *         $ divine verify -p assert at-bug2.bc -d
 *         $ divine verify -p exclusion at-bug2.bc -d
 *
 *  - customizing the number of threads:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-DNUM_OF_THREADS=5" at.c
 *         $ divine verify -p assert at.bc -d
 *         $ divine verify -p exclusion at.bc -d
 *
 * Execution
 * ---------
 *
 *       $ clang -lpthread -o at.exe at.c
 *       $ ./at.exe
