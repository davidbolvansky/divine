 * Bridge
 * ======
 *
 *  Puzzle about men crossing a bridge.
 *
 *  *tags*: puzzle, C99
 *
 * Description
 * -----------
 *
 *  This program is more or less just a demonstration of one possible usage of
 *  `__divine_choice` builtin.
 *  You can use this builtin for writing non-deterministic algorithms and then
 *  let DiVinE to do a complete search in order to find out if there is any
 *  computational path leading to a correct solution.
 *
 *  * __Task__: solve puzzle of soldiers going over bridge
 *
 *      * _Input_: N soldiers and their individual times + overall time limit
 *
 *      * _Output_: "Yes" if it is possible for soldiers to get to the other
 *                  side within the time limit, "No" otherwise
 *
 *  * __Rules__: Four men (soldiers) have to cross a bridge at night.
 *               The bridge is old and dilapidated and can hold at most two
 *               people at a time. There are no railings, and the men have only
 *               one flashlight. Any party who crosses, either one or two men,
 *               must carry the flashlight with them. The flashlight must be
 *               walked back and forth; it cannot be thrown, etc. Each man walks
 *               at a different speed. One takes 5 minute to cross, another 10
 *               minutes, another 20, and the last 25 minutes. If two men cross
 *               together, they must walk at the slower man's pace. Can they
 *               get to the other side in 60 minutes? (The program is generalized
 *               for larger number of men.)
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 *
 *  - `N`: a number of soldiers
 *  - `TIME_LIMIT`: overall time limit
 *
 * Solution
 * --------
 *
 *  - solve the puzzle for the default values of parameters:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm bridge.c
 *         $ divine verify -p assert bridge.bc -d
 *
 *  - solving for redefined values of parameters:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-DN=6 -DTIME_LIMIT=120" bridge.c
 *         $ divine verify -p assert bridge.bc -d
 *
 *  <!-- -->
 *
 *  Output is rather unintuitive. We actually verify if it holds that
 *  there is no solution:
 *
 *    - property HOLDS        = there is no solution
 *    - property DOESN'T HOLD = there is a solution
 *    - counterexample        = solution
