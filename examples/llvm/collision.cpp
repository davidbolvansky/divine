 * Collision
 * =========
 *
 *  A simple collision avoidance protocol.
 *
 *  *tags*: communication protocol, C++11
 *
 * Description
 * -----------
 *
 *  We assume that a number of stations are connected on an *Ethernet-like* medium,
 *  that is, the basic protocol is of type *CSMA/CD*. On the top of this basic protocol
 *  we want to design a protocol without collisions. This is a simple solution
 *  with a dedicated master station, which in turn asks the other stations if they
 *  want to transmit data to another station.
 *
 *  Original idea comes from the paper listed among references.
 *  Authors of this paper presented a model which assumes an existence of some
 *  dedicated links between the master station and slave stations.
 *  Throught this links the master can obtain current state of each slave and
 *  figure out when is the right time to pass the token to the next slave in the row.
 *  However the actual token is send over the ethernet instead, hence different
 *  channels are used to manage token passing.
 *  In order to eliminate this discrepancy and make the algorithm a bit more practical,
 *  we present a modified version in which all communication between master and slave
 *  stations goes throught the ethernet medium. This is done by implementing a new message
 *  type representing a token being returned from a slave to the master.
 *  If the thread that received the token is not interested to send any message, a message
 *  returning the token to the master is send immediately (more precisely -- when the medium
 *  becomes free). Otherwise the token owner sends a message wrapping both actual data and
 *  the token to the recipient of his choice, which is than obligated to return the token
 *  to the master immediately after the message receipt (without having permission to
 *  use it).
 *
 *  When a message is send over the ethernet medium, it gets broadcasted to all connected
 *  stations (except the one from which it came from). Inherently this operation isn't
 *  atomic, and so when a slave receives the token, even thought it has got the permission
 *  to send a message, it can't start doing so immediately, but has to wait until the last
 *  broadcast finnishes and medium becomes free. This is violated when the program is built
 *  with a macro `BUG` defined.

 * Parameters
 * ----------
 *
 *  - `BUG`: if defined than the algorithm is incorrect and violates the safety property
 *  - `NUM_OF_THREADS`: a number of stations connected to the ethernet (includes the master)
 *  - `NUM_OF_PASSES`: how many times the token is passed from one station to another
 *                     (with the aid of the master) before the algorithm finishes (`-1` = infinity)
 *
 * Verification
 * ------------
 *
 *  - all available properties with the default values of parameters:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-std=c++11" collision.cpp
 *         $ divine verify -p assert collision.bc -d
 *         $ divine verify -p deadlock collision.bc -d
 *
 *  - introducing a bug:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-std=c++11 -DBUG" collision.cpp -o collision-bug.bc
 *         $ divine verify -p assert collision-bug.bc -d
 *
 *  - customizing the parameters:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-std=c++11 -DNUM_OF_THREADS=4 -DNUM_OF_PASSES=3" collision.c
 *         $ divine verify -p assert collision.bc -d
 *
 * Execution
 * ---------
 *
 *       $ clang++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -lstdc++ -o collision.exe collision.cpp
 *       $ ./collision.exe
