 * Leader election in an Uni-circle (Peterson)
 * ===========================================
 *
 *  A simulation of Peterson's O(n*log(n)) unidirectional distributed algorithm
 *  for extrema finding in a circle.
 *
 *  *tags*: leader election, C++11
 *
 * Description
 * -----------
 *
 *  Given `n` processes in a ring, communicating only with message passing to its right
 *  neighbour, the unidirectional circular extrema-finding problem (more likely known as a leader
 *  election problem) is to select a maximum (or minimum) process.
 *  Each process has a unique value, called ID, in a set with a total order. These values
 *  may be transmitted and compared. All processes are identical (except for their IDs) and `n`,
 *  the number of processes, is not initially known.
 *
 *  The algorithm presented here is due to Gary L. Peterson [1] and it is an improvement
 *  over the Basic algorithm (also presented in [1]), as it uses at most only
 *  1.44*n * log(n) + O(n) message passes.
 *
 *  The idea of the algorithm is similar to that of the Basic algorithm, except that the local
 *  maxima test is split into two separate steps, the first is comparison with the left active
 *  process and the second is comparison to the right. The former step might be sufficient to
 *  disprove the maximality and so in such case the latter comparison is skipped, thus
 *  the number of messages sent is reduced (by a constant factor).
 *
 *  At each iteration (= phase) all local maximas (among active IDs) are found and kept also for
 *  the next phase, while the rest is dismisshed. This way the number of active processes
 *  lowers after each phase by a half at least. But while doing so, each maximum moves to
 *  the next active process on the right side, as it is the only reasonable method as to
 *  compare 3 adjacent IDs in unidirectional circle. And so after each phase the active process
 *  becomes either passive or it starts represent the maximum previously owned by its nearest active
 *  process to the left. But when compiled with `-DBUG`, local maximas don't make the move and
 *  therefore get dismisshed.

 * Parameters
 * ----------
 *
 *  - `BUG`: if defined than the algorithm is incorrect and violates the safety property
 *  - `NUM_OF_PROCESSES`: a number of processes in the ring
 *  - `PIDS`: a distribution of identification numbers among processes to verify;
 *            use the syntax for static array declaration in C/C++, i.e. `{ x, y, z, ...}`;
 *            length of the array must match `NUM_OF_PROCESSES`
 *  - `MSG_BUFFER_SIZE`: how many messages can be buffered at each node
 *
 * LTL Properties
 * --------------
 *
 *  - `progress`: leader will be eventually elected (but does not cover uniqueness)
 *
 * Verification
 * ------------
 *
 *  - all available properties with the default values of parameters:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-std=c++11" leader-unicircle_peterson.cpp
 *         $ divine verify -p assert leader-unicircle_peterson.bc -d
 *         $ divine verify -p deadlock leader-unicircle_peterson.bc -d
 *         $ divine verify -p progress leader-unicircle_peterson.bc -f -d
 *
 *  - introducing a bug:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-std=c++11 -DBUG" leader-unicircle_peterson.cpp -o leader-unicircle_peterson-bug.bc
 *         $ divine verify -p assert leader-unicircle_peterson-bug.bc -d
 *
 *  - customizing the number of processes and the distribution of IDs:
 *
 *         $ divine compile --llvm --cflags="-std=c++11 -DNUM_OF_PROCESSES=4 -DPIDS=\"{2, 3, 4, 1}\"" leader-unicircle_peterson.cpp

 *         $ divine verify -p assert leader-unicircle_peterson.bc -d
 *
 * Execution
 * ---------
 *
