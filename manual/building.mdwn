Installation
============

If you are using the Windows installer, just execute the downloaded file and
follow the installation wizard. Consult your distribution's manual for
instructions on installing binary packages. The rest of this section is only
relevant when you are installing from source.

We will assume that you have obtained a source tarball from
http://divine.fi.muni.cz, eg. `divine-3.0.tar.gz`.

Prerequisites
-------------

* A POSIX-compatible operating system (tested on Linux), or NT-based 32 bit Windows.
* Recent GNU C++ (4.7 or later) or clang (3.2 or later). MinGW on Windows.
* Cmake \[[www.cmake.org](http://www.cmake.org)\]  
  Note: If your computer is connected to the Internet during installation, the
  configure script is able to download and compile cmake package for you.
* About 2GB of disk space. 4GB of RAM is recommended.
* Various optional components of DiVinE have further dependencies. Please
  consult the output from `cmake` to determine what other libraries or tools
  you may need:

    - LLVM 3.2 or later (headers and libraries) are required for LLVM bitcode verification.
    - CLang 3.2 or later is required at *runtime* for `divine compile --llvm`.
    - Qt 4.5 or later is required for the GUI.
    - Boost libraries and libxml2 are required for verification of UPPAAL timed
      automata.
    - Pandoc is required for building HTML and PDF (also needs pdflatex) manual.
    - MPI header files and libraries (preferably OpenMPI) for distributed
      verification.
    - `flex` and `byacc` for verification of Murphi models.

Instructions
------------

First, unzip the distribution tarball and enter the newly created directory

    $ tar xvzf divine-3.0.tar.gz
    $ cd divine-3.0

### Configuration

        $ ./configure
        $ make

The configure script will tell you what options you have available and what
external packages you may be missing. To inspect configuration variables in
more detail, you can use `ccmake`:

    $ (cd _build ; ccmake .)

Edit the variable content to your liking and use `c` and `g` keys to re-run
configuration and re-generate makefiles, respectively.

### External Programs

Some parts of divine, especially the `compile` and `combine` sub-commands will
need to run external tools. By default, divine will expect to find these
commands in your `PATH` under their common names. If you are building a
distribution package for a system which installs these commands under uncommon
names, you should use cmake variables (check all variables start with
`CMD_`). While you can override the commands to use on divine's command-line
later (using `--cmd-xxx=yyy` switches), this may be somewhat inconvenient.

**NB.** Please take extra care that the "GNU gold" linker you are providing to
divine has plugin support, and that you provide correct path to the
`LLVMgold.so` plugin. A working installation of both is mandatory for `divine
compile --llvm`.

### Build and Installation

When you are satisfied with the configuration options, start the build with:

    $ make

and relax, this is going to take a while. When the build is done, you should
check that your installation is working as expected:

    $ cd _build/tools
    $ ./divine help
    $ ./divine verify ../../examples/dve/shuffle.dve
    $ ./divine verify -p LTL ../../examples/dve/peterson-liveness.dve
    $ ./divine verify -p LTL ../../examples/dve/peterson-naive.dve

You can also run the test-suites, to ensure that divine is working properly on
your system and with your versions of libraries and tools:

    $ make check

While there is no need to install the binary (it is self-contained and you can
move or copy it to a location of your choice), you can easily install divine
system-wide for convenient access:

    # make install
