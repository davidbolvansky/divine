Installation
============

If you are using the Windows installer, just execute the downloaded file and
follow the installation wizard. Consult your distribution's manual for
instructions on installing binary packages. The rest of this section is only
relevant when you are installing from source.

We will assume that you have obtained a source tarball from
http://divine.fi.muni.cz, eg. `divine-3.0.tar.gz`.

Prerequisites
-------------

* A POSIX-compatible operating system (tested on Linux), or NT-based 32 bit Windows.
* Recent GNU C++ (4.7 or later) or clang (3.2 or later). MinGW on Windows.
* Cmake \[[www.cmake.org](http://www.cmake.org)\]  
  Note: If your computer is connected to the Internet during installation, the
  configure script is able to download and compile cmake package for you.
* About 2GB of disk space. 4GB of RAM is recommended.
* Various optional components of DiVinE have further dependencies. Please
  consult the output from `cmake` to determine what other libraries or tools
  you may need:

    - LLVM headers and libraries are required for LLVM bitcode verification.
    - Qt 4.5 or later is required for the GUI.
    - Boost libraries and libxml2 are required for verification of UPPAAL timed
      automata.
    - Pandoc is required for building HTML and PDF (also needs pdflatex) manual.
    - MPI header files and libraries (preferably OpenMPI) for distributed
      verification.
    - flex and byacc for verification of Murphi models.

Instructions
------------

* Unzip the distribution tarball and enter the newly created directory

        $ tar xvzf divine-3.0.tar.gz
        $ cd divine-3.0

* Now configure and compile the package:

        $ ./configure
        $ make

* And test that the compilation succeeded.

        $ cd _build/tools
        $ ./divine help
        $ ./divine verify ../../examples/dve/shuffle.dve
        $ ./divine verify -p LTL ../../examples/dve/peterson-liveness.dve
        $ ./divine verify -p LTL ../../examples/dve/peterson-naive.dve

* There is no need to install the binary, it is self-contained. However,
  if you like, you can install divine for more convenient access:

        # make install
