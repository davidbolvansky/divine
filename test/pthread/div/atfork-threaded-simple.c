* This sample test aims to check the following assertions:
*
* pthread_atfork registers the 'prepare' handler to be called before fork()
* processing in the context of the fork() calling thread.
*
* pthread_atfork registers the 'parent' handler to be called after fork()
* processing in the context of the fork() calling thread in the parent process.
*
* pthread_atfork registers the 'child' handler to be called after fork()
* processing in the context of the fork() calling thread in the child process.


* The steps are:
* -> Create a new thread
* -> Call pthread_atfork from the main thread.
* -> Child thread forks.
* -> Check that the handlers have been called, and in the context of the
*    calling thread.

* The test fails if the thread executing the handlers is not the one expected,
* or if the handlers are not executed.
