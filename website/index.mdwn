> <span class="divine">DIVINE</span> is a modern explicit-state model
> checker. Building on high足-per足for足mance algorithms and data structures, it
> offers unparalleled versatility, sca足ling from a typical developer's laptop,
> up to a high-end compute cluster. What more, it can verify a wide range of
> languages, including **C** and **C++**. Learn more in the

Feature Highlights
==================

 * Verifies models in multiple **input formats**:
    - **LLVM** bitcode (suitble for model checking C and C++ code)
    - **UPPAAL** timed automata
    - **DVE** -- the original DIVINE modelling languageg
    - user-implemented, compiled models via [CESMI] [3]
    - **MurPHI**, including symmetry reduction
    - **CoIn** -- for modelling with component interaction automata
 * Executes on a cluster of multi-core machines
 * Partial order reduction for DVE, CoIn
 * Runs on **Linux** and **MS Windows** (a Windows installer is available)
 * A **GUI**, with a simulator and a counter-example analyser for DVE

DIVINE 3.0 RC 2 has been released
=================================

(2013-04-16) A release candidate has been released today (unless serious bugs
are found in this release, it will become 3.0 final). Get the [source code] [1]
or [pre-built binaries] [2]! The changelog is here: [what's
new](whatsnew.html). The major highlights are:

 * Support for model checking of C and C++ code via LLVM bitcode (safety and LTL).
 * Model checking of timed automata (safety, time deadlocks and untimed LTL).
 * A stable binary interface for compiled models: [CESMI] [3].
 * Weak fairness for DVE.
 * Hash compaction.
 * Experimental support for shared-memory hashtables and queues.
