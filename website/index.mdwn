DIVINE is a tool for LTL model checking and reachability analysis of discrete
distributed systems. The tool is able to efficiently exploit the aggregate
computing power of multiple network-interconnected multi-cored workstations in
order to deal with extremely large verification tasks. As such it allows to
analyse systems whose size is far beyond the size of systems that can be
handled with regular sequential tools.

New developments in DIVINE include:

 * Execution on cluster of multi-core workstations
 * On-the-fly verification
 * Execution of models compiled to binary code
 * Parallel partial order reduction
 * Support for MS windows
 * Graphical user interface
 * Support for Murphi models

Version 2.5 Now Available
=========================

**(2011-04-05) UPDATE**: A minor revision to 2.5 has been released, with
version number 2.5.1, and fixing a few important bugs in the DVE compiler. All
users of the DVE compiler are strongly advised to update to this version.

(2011-03-01) The DIVINE team has released a new version of its parallel LTL
model checking tool. This version brings further improvements in verification
performance, as well as a few new major features:

 * A new command, "divine draw" has been added to the suite of support tools,
   enabling graphviz-based visualisation of model state spaces and
   counterexample traces. The graphviz package needs to be installed to make
   this functionality available. Please see divine draw --help for usage
   instructions.

 * A new input language, CoIN is now available for use with DiVinE.

   Component-interaction automata language (CI Automata, or CoIn Automata for
   short) was designed for modelling of component interactions in hierarchical
   component-based software systems. The language supports modelling of
   important interaction attributes of such systems, and hence provides a rich
   base for further application of formal methods. Component-based systems,
   that are to be modelled, are usually connected to a particular component
   model. For this reason, Component-interaction automata are very general and
   support modelling of component interactions in component-based systems built
   on various component models.

 * Support for the Windows platform has been further improved, with "divine
   combine" now being available, completing the toolchain for model development
   and model checking.

Moreover, a number of bugfixes and minor improvements have been made in this
release. You can [**download the new version here**] [1].
