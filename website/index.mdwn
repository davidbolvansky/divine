> <span class="divine">DIVINE</span> is a modern explicit-state model
> checker. Building on high­-per­for­mance algorithms and data structures, it
> offers unparalleled versatility, sca­ling from a typical developer's laptop,
> up to a high-end compute cluster. What more, it can verify a wide range of

Feature Highlights
==================

 * Verifies models in multiple **input formats**:
    - **LLVM** bitcode (suitable for model checking C and C++ code)
    - **UPPAAL** timed automata
    - **DVE** -- the original DIVINE modelling language
    - user-implemented, compiled models via [CESMI] [3]
    - **MurPHI**, including symmetry reduction
    - **CoIn** -- for modelling with component interaction automata
 * Executes on a cluster of multi-core machines
 * Partial order reduction for DVE, CoIn
 * Runs on **Linux** and **MS Windows** (a Windows installer is available)
 * A **GUI**, with a simulator and a counter-example analyser for DVE

DIVINE 3.0 has been released
============================

(2013-07-13) The final version of DIVINE 3.0 has been released today. Get the
[source code] [1] or [pre-built binaries] [2]! The changelog is here: [what's
new](whatsnew.html). The major highlights of the 3.0 release are:

 * Support for model checking of C and C++ code via LLVM bitcode (safety and LTL).
 * Model checking of timed automata (safety, time deadlocks and untimed LTL).
 * A stable binary interface for compiled models: [CESMI] [3].
 * Weak fairness for DVE.
 * Hash compaction.
 * Experimental support for shared-memory hashtables and queues.

DIVINE 3.1 beta 1 has been released
===================================

(2014-01-06) We are pleased to announce the first beta release in preparation of
version 3.1 of DIVINE. Please download the [source code] [1] (or visit [our
hydra] [4] to obtain recent binary snapshots) and help us by testing this
pre-release.

The major improvements making a debut in version 3.1 are more sophisticated
shared-memory verification, lossless tree-based state space compression,
improved performance and substantially improved memory efficiency. The series
also includes improved support for compilation of C++ into LLVM bitcode (now
including the standard library out of the box) and improvements to the DVE
specification language. The LLVM backend has gained a number of improvements,
including more sophisticated error detection and reporting.

Additionally, a number of improvements and bug fixes has been added since the
last alpha release in autumn. Please consult the [changelog] [5].
